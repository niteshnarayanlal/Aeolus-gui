Aeolus-gui is an gui desktop end application for Aeolus which is been made to provide an easy to use interface to the user .
For running the application you need to have Qt libraries , if you are working on KDE then I think you already will be having sufficient libraries .
Then you need to compile command.c file once to generate its corresponding object file used by the application .

To install Qt-creator 
-yum install qt qt-devel
Clone the Aeolus-gui repository from github
-git clone https://github.com/niteshnarayanlal/Aeolus-gui.git
Compiling command.c open your Aeolus-gui folder
-gcc command.c -o command
Now you are good to go open your Aeouls-gui folder
-open Aeolus.pro folder with Qt-creator
-you will see the application running 
-After compiling it once you can run the application directly by moving the Aeouls-gui folder and typing ./Aeolus
